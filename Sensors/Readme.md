## Sensors
I want to collect some sensors that could easily read by raspberry pi (3B+) using python (version 3.5+). This will offer time series data.   

### [ThingSpeak.COM](ThingSpeak.COM/README.md)
[ThingSpeak.COM](https://github.com/iobridge/thingspeak) is an open source “Internet of Things” application and API to store and retrieve data from things using HTTP over the Internet or via a Local Area Network. With ThingSpeak, you can create sensor logging applications, location tracking applications, and a social network of things with status updates.
