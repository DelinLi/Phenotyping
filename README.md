## Phenotyping
Genetics Researchers embarrassed with high throughput sequencing revolution for the last decades and made tremendous progress. Meanwhile, the phenotyping didn't have a huge change and is becoming one of the bottlenecks in my era. However, there are numerous technology or devices, like computer vision, Neural Networks & Deep Learning, cheap but effective sensors, the raspberry pi ... I want to play with that stuff.
